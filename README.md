# MNIST-Dataset-using-Keras

In this I have used CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) to predict the numbers which are hand-written.
I've used Keras(Deep Learning Library) to construct the CNN(which is best Neural Network for image related).
I have included both the .ipynb and .py files (you can use according to your wish). Better go for .ipynb file if you have Jupyter Notebook, you can get it from this link (https://jupyter.org/).
To get this up and running you need to have Keras to be installed on your machine.

Before installing Keras, please install one of its backend engines: TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK. I recommend the TensorFlow backend.

After having that you can install Keras by using this command:
  pip install keras
